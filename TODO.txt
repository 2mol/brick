Features:
  * High priority:
    - Text wrapping (with markup)
    - Multi-line text editing
    - Load & save attribute map to on-disk configuration
    - API for obtaining scrolling viewport state in EventM (will
      staleness be an issue here?)
  * Low priority:
    - Deal with multi-column characters everywhere

Open issues:
- Centering and other operations pad widgets with fills with interacts
with layering depending on the user's intentions. Sometimes we want
layers to be opaque and filled, other times we want them to be
transparent.  How do we deal with this in general?

* Getting started: simpleMain, defaultMain
* API conventions: lens / non-lens interfaces, attribute name exports
* customMain and the App type
  - Event handlers and HandleEvent
  - Cursor selection
  - Suspend & resume, halt, continue
