- padAll/padLeftRight/padTopBottom Max do not behave as expected

Features:
- Text wrapping (with markup)
- Deal with multi-column characters everywhere

Open issues:
- Centering and other operations pad widgets with fills with interacts
with layering depending on the user's intentions. Sometimes we want
layers to be opaque and filled, other times we want them to be
transparent.  How do we deal with this in general?
