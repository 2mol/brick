Features:
  * High priority:
    - Text wrapping (with markup)
    - Load & save attribute map to on-disk configuration
    - API for obtaining scrolling viewport state in EventM (will
      staleness be an issue here?)
  * Low priority:
    - Deal with multi-column characters everywhere

Open issues:
- Are there better or less error-prone ways of dealing with Names?
- Centering and other operations pad widgets with fills with interacts
with layering depending on the user's intentions. Sometimes we want
layers to be opaque and filled, other times we want them to be
transparent.  How do we deal with this in general?
