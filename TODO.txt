Bugs / design issues:
- Fix cursor and visibility request cropping in primitives where missing
- Consider adding L suffix to Context lenses to be consistent with other
lenses

Features:
- Text wrapping
- Deal with multi-column characters everywhere
- Port widgets from vty-ui
- Overlays relative to a specific widget (e.g. drop-downs) using layers
but without having to know the position of the controlling widget (e.g.
add a combinator in one layer to refer to something in another). In
general, an API for multi-layer rendering might emerge from this.

Performance:
- Use a zipper for the list widget, use vectors for storage, or
  generalize interface to some traversable so the caller decides what
  structure to use (e.g. tree, vector). This would also require the
  generalization of a "selection index"
- Use Vector instead of List where sensible

Open issues:
- Centering and other operations pad widgets with fills with interacts
with layering depending on the user's intentions. Sometimes we want
layers to be opaque and filled, other times we want them to be
transparent.  How do we deal with this in general?
