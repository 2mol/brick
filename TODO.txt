Misc:
  * Consider updating editor to use smart translation similiar to list
    to enable editing of big documents

Features:
  * High priority:
    - Text wrapping (with markup)
    - Load & save attribute map to on-disk configuration
    - API for obtaining scrolling viewport state in EventM (will
      staleness be an issue here?)
  * Low priority:
    - Deal with multi-column characters everywhere
