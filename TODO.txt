Bugs / design issues:
- Consider adding L suffix to Context and other core lenses to be
consistent with other lenses

Features:
- Text wrapping
- Deal with multi-column characters everywhere
- Port widgets from vty-ui:
  - Progress bar?
  - Dir browser?
  - Checkbox?
  - Button?
- Overlays relative to a specific widget (e.g. drop-downs) using layers
but without having to know the position of the controlling widget (e.g.
add a combinator in one layer to refer to something in another). In
general, an API for multi-layer rendering might emerge from this.

Open issues:
- Centering and other operations pad widgets with fills with interacts
with layering depending on the user's intentions. Sometimes we want
layers to be opaque and filled, other times we want them to be
transparent.  How do we deal with this in general?
