Bugs / design issues:
- Fix cursor cropping in render function where missing
- Deal with hRelease/vRelease differently, e.g. by using Maybe to
contain width and height in the context, and behave differently if
they're Nothing (same for boxes?)
- Do we need CropLeftBy and CropTopBy if we just Translate negatively?
- Unify h/vbox implementation as one function configured by lenses and
functions needed to perform the layout and combine the results

Features:
- Text manipulation API
  - monoid instance
  - RLE attribute assignment with successive transformations?
  - wrapping
- Default and override attributes in rendering context, plus combinators
to manage them
- Think of better library name
- Implement 2-d text editing
- Deal with multi-column characters everywhere
- Port widgets from vty-ui
- Support "suggested" vs "forced" attributes in Prim rendering
- Viewports: support scrolling modes that don't require specific
visibility requests (think scrolling through a text document with no
cursor)

Performance:
- Write benchmarks for render on various primitive types
- Use a zipper for the list widget, use vectors for storage
- Use Vector instead of List where sensible
